Assignment 4 Website version

- online with boundary layer and rent layer
	- rent layer is not following proper buckets, not sure how to solve


All layers are added

Tasks:
- Layers panel
- Legend
- search query


Problems:
- Icons are pretty small
    - when you hover it should expand
    - when you click and it zooms in, it should keep
-for some reason it is still adding in the urls at the end of the link... need to fix this somehow
    - i think it has to do with the url formatting; needs to begin with `http`
- popups are dependant on the order the layers are added to the map
    - eateries will show up if eateries is added to the map last
    - ^same with PSE


Done:
    tasks:
        - add a reset zoom button that zooms back out to the center and default of the map
    bugs
        - popup is at the location of click instead of location of Institution (FIXED)
